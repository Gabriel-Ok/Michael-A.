<p>I spend an hour or two thinking
What title shall I give this writing,
I look at my pen and paper
What name shall I give this story, I ask
The blank paper looks at me defiantly
And the pen,
Drips ink slowly and silently
But, I have to write.</p>

<p>A story is usually written in the mind,
But like all things on our minds
A way of expressing it is hard to find.
So, I turn to Google my old friend
"What's on your mind, Michael?"
No. That is Facebook.
I rush to close the page,
Wait a minute, isn't that WWE's Paige?</p>


<p>I just remembered I had a poem to write
Sorry, distractions left and right
My original idea of this poem is now lost
Thanks to the distraction
Wait, I remember now
 The most beautiful line I will ever write,
"You may trod me in the very dirt,
But still, like dust, I'll rise."
I rush to publish the poem,
But wait, isn't that Maya Angelou's line?</p>

<p>Darkness covers my thoughts
A white knight, I'll need to save my soul
The rhyme is certainly lacking: thoughts and soul?
And what of the logic?
I have to find better words to write this poem
But...Where shall I get them?
Just write what you think,
And express your feelings with words, it's your thing.
My inner self tells me so
But, kind Sir, residing in my body,
My thoughts are too random,
And my words are too common...</p>



<p>But still, I write.
I fumble with words,
I most certainly have lost my art.
A few years ago, a poem or two in an hour I'd write
A poem so colorful that I would hate to share
Yes, jealousy at its finest
But, it's not a few years ago, it is now
This moment
And I Write.</p>

<p>Talented they say,
Gifted they say,
Blessed even.
Well, don't lose what they say.
But most importantly,
Don't forget your potential,
And dream
For there is only one you
With a unique talent and gift.</p>

<p>I feel sorrow,
I set to write a poem,
But ended up with seven stanzas of random words
Surely, I have no tomorrow
In the world of poets
But,
I'll Write.
</p>

                  <p>

We landed on US soil on some day in August, 2014. It was at O'Hare International Airport, Chicago. It had rained earlier, so the ground was wet-or was that in Kansas City? I honestly don't remember that well and I don't blame myself either. Who cares? I was finally in The United States of America- Yes, the one I used to see on TV and Magazines! "Just think about it Michael! Quality education, great job opportunities, amazing natural sceneries, insane skyscrapers, money, cool cars, cute girls...!" (Actually, it begins with the cute girls going backwards). Chicago was not a disappointment at all because the insane skyscrapers were there, but we had a short time before flying to Kansas City which was pretty cool! My sister and her family were gonna meet us there and drive us home. "Hey, Mike...You know you just called a house in the US home?"-Yes, that was the situation inside my mind at the moment. I was not sure whether I was more excited after hugging my sister for the first time in 7 years, or after a few 'American raindrops' fell on my face. I used to joke with my brothers that I'd rather be a fly in a rich man's house in the US rather than be in our countryside village. Big twist huh.
</p>
<p>
When you are an outsider from a third world country, and you hear about the US, it is some sort of unreachable, Heaven of sorts. You never even think of a place where there's no skyscraper. (Yeah, I know, I watched too many spiderman movies-skyscrapers everywhere). Anyway, the road from Kansas City to wherever we were going seemed amazingly pretty boring, but I consoled myself saying perhaps it's just the darkness in the outskirts of town. Eventually, sleep won in the end and I woke up next at my sister's place, ready to sleep in a real bed. "Tomorrow we tour the city! This. Is. America!" (My brain just wouldn't shut down for the night without motivating me with a Sparta-inspired quote first). We made it. I made it. Goodnight was in order.
</p>
<p>
You see, it's not that I haven't seen white people before. I've seen them on TVs, Magazines- wait, in face to face interactions, I've seen at least tens and tens of them in one place at The Village Market, in Kenya. But I had never seen potentially, hundreds of them at once. My head was spinning, my eyes were wide, my nose forgot to breathe and my skin...well, haha! We were in Mizzou, Columbia and it was during the summer. I had honestly never seen so many of them and the worst part is- "They all look the same Michael! I'm out of here, you are on your own man!" (That was my mind shutting down on me when I needed it the most). The girls wore really short, short skirts, dresses and shorts. You know, even in Nairobi, the most urbanized area in Kenya that can dare rival some major cities in the world, nothing like what I saw existed there, at least not in broad daylight. Yes, maybe 10 or so, but not everywhere! They call it freedom, I called it immoral. But now I call it freedom. Yes, where was I? Oh, the "They all look the same" part. So, in my first week in the US, I used clothes to distinguish people, especially the ladies. If one changed the attire, I'd swear I've never seen them before. Oh, there used to be this popular myth in Kenya, that "dem mzungu hana haga" (I am not translating this, because I still have use for my throat. But haga = ass) but my first week here taught me otherwise.
</p>
<p>
I usually think that my introvert behaviors intensified after that experience in Mizzou. We headed home after that brief visit and something even more terrifying happened. A Four. Way. Stop. I feel like I should stop typing because of the memories, but hey, I came this far right? So, four cars, two pairs facing each other. I frantically looked for the traffic police-there's none. Traffic lights?-None. "HEY! HEY! WHERE IS SHE GOING? IS SHE BLIND?! STOP! STOP! Look at this one too!!!" . 'This one too' was actually my sister. The car opposite us was coming towards us, and we 'plunged' forward and the car to our right also started moving..."Hey Mikey. At least you made it to the US before you died. But you can also try and jump through that door- If your sister is gonna crash this car, at least you go out fighting!" That was my mind coming back to its senses after ditching me when it saw many white girls and boys in their (almost) hundreds. But no, I was just gonna close my eyes and wait for the bang but the only sound I heard was from my tummy as it growled for something to eat. My first week huh?
</p>
<p>
And then I arrived...to my second week.

Clocks ever tick, time ever flies or walks by depending on the kind of life you're living... Each and every day, the sun rises and sets without failure, marking the beginning and ending of a day. Each sunrise, we begin a new day and try to better our yesterday...
I Find It 'Funny' though, where did yesterday go to? I happen to be a fan of DC Comic's The Flash and the show at one time focuses on the ability of the scarlet speedsters to travel through time, into the past or the future. Several other movies have also portrayed this kind of possibility...of time travel. But we all know those are fantasies. Well, I really don't know what scientists in real life are attempting to do to unravel this mystery, but one thing I'm quite sure of is that all attempts, are just but in vain.
</p>
<p>
Well, scientists can come up with awkward conclusions by the way. There's this joke about a scientist who performed an experiment on a frog. He cut off the frog's limbs and said to the frog "JUMP!". The frog did not jump. He therefore concluded that when frogs lose their legs, they become deaf.
Well, dear scientists, we appreciate your efforts but you should understand that there is a supreme being behind all of these, whether you like it or not.
</p>
<p>
I Find It Funny when I stop to think that maybe, I died yesterday (God forbid), but then the events were reversed in that they never took place or all these memories were wiped away, somehow. I know that sounds silly. But who knows? We can't revisit yesterday...but why not? But I also remember that God, is perfect and doesn't make mistakes.
</p>
<p>
When I was a kid, I used to think that there's a door to yesterday and a door to tomorrow somewhere. When God closes the door to yesterday, then we would all enter into a new day. But it never was, until I learned that every time the clock strikes 12 at night, a new day is born. This is what I have believed all my life, and so have all of you. Sometimes I think, what if that is not the case? I mean, these 'time spaces' were created by human beings to bring forth orderliness...something that only humans use and not other living creatures like dogs, cats etc. Well, I have a theory of my own on this "Time" aspect.

</p>
<p>
When God created the world, He purposefully separated daylight from darkness. This was a perfect move. A move that came to bore what we use now...these time spaces. God is orderly, and so He wanted man to be too. According to how understand this concept, time; the hours, days, weeks...are just but a division of events. Wednesday and Thursday, are the same...May 6, 1995 and May 6, 2015 are the same day. If you believe that these days are not the same, then why does the sun rise from the East and set in the West everyday? Of course, you'll say rotation. Nice answer. Now, Think Again.
</p>
<p>
Supposing there was no darkness...just light/day, and no measure of time? A life whereby you sleep at your own moment of liking. That would be a chaotic and non orderly world. So, to the scientists attempting to create a time travel machine or something of that sort, get it straight into your heads that there is NO yesterday. Yesterday was created by humans, virtually, and you cannot travel into nothingness. Stop wasting money doing nothing. PS: A word of advice.
</p>
<p>
The time is now 17:48, May 6 2015. This is what we created and what is most convenient for us to use, and I'm sure God is pleased with that progress. But the reality is that, these are all virtual. No wonder, if you're a Christian or a reader of the Bible, 2 Peter 3:8 says that, "But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day."
</p>
<p>
I asked a question, I hope you thought again and have the answer with you.

                           Puppets...puppets all over tangling in strings. Fans of The Avengers: Age Of Ultron relate well to that. The moment when Ultron says "You're all puppets, tangled in strings... strings!"
</p>
<p>
Well, Ultron is a fictional character and has some of you wondering what's up! Sadly, though not on the same page as Ultron, I completely agree with the AI that humans, a majority of us are just but puppets. Puppets suspended in the air held by strings that define our every moments, thoughts and actions.

</p>
<p>
Freedom is a gift. Freedom is a blessing. A vast majority of us enjoy freedom; Physical freedom, at least. Our minds are still prisoners, slaves, to cultures that degrade every sense in the word "Human". Cultures characterised by the strive to look/appear "dope", to act "cool n dope"...which at the end of the day, results to the so called "dope" fellas actually take a dope test and the results, are obviously disappointing.Yes, I know there is cool, cool...and there is "cool".

</p>
<p>
People my age, a few years younger and a couple years older fall prey to the so called "young, free and wild". Songs like "Young, Wild and Free" by Wiz Khalifa, Snoop Dogg and Bruno Mars, actually portrays the kind of slavery trap that most young minds fall into. They say exactly what these minds want to hear...this is their point of motivation. Below is the hook from the song.

</p>
<p>
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
</p>

That is just but one example of the many strings that are attached to us. We make decisions, do actions, based on these. I'm not criticising the three artistes, NO. But, hey, they are living the life they worked hard to climb to. I'm pretty sure that if they were living to the "young, wild and free" slogan, they wouldn't be making it big time now. Think about that. Don't just let these strings pull you left, right or wherever...listen to the music, if it does make you relax; watch the movie, if it does help you in any way that there is. But don't be a puppet, dancing to everything that comes out of them.

I wanted a Facebook Page, so I created one...
I wanted a blog, so I created one...
I wanted to play soccer, so I bought a pair of soccer boots and a soccer ball...
It looks like I have a power in me, to get what I desire in my grip. I'm just a two decades old boy, or maybe man(depends on where you come from) with a certain drive in me. We all have this...an inner motivation, drive. Unfortunately, society has these strings on us...that limit us. The worst part is that they're almost invisible because they are a part of our daily lives and seem just OK.
</p>
<p>
Everyone has their demons to dance with, just like everyone has their strings. What's your string? What are you going to do about it? How are you going to identify it...to start with. The moment you pinpoint the strings attached on you...on your mind by the various popular cultures, that will be your moment of reckoning.
</p>
<p>
I'm not preaching, nor am I denouncing anything or anyone. I'm just stating an observation...it's what I do. The real question is what are you going to do? Quit being just a part of the lost crowd.

As they say, will you be "the real MVP"?
